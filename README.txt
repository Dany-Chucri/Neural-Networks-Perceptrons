We implemented both the perceptron and neural network algorithms as a part of this project.

To test perceptron, just run "python perceptron.py" and follow the prompts in the console to
choose betwen digits and faces. Then choose which data set to test with.

To test the neural network, run either "python NeuralNetworkDigitsDriver.py" to run the
neural network for digit classification or "python NeuralNetworkFacesDriver.py" to run the
neural network for facial classification.
